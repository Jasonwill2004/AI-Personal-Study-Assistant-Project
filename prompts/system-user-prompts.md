## 🔧 **Implementation Examples with Performance Metrics**

### **Example 1: Optimized Mathematics Response**

**User Input:**
```
ROLE: Act as my mathematics tutor, EduGPT-Math
TASK: Help me solve this quadratic equation: 2x² - 8x + 6 = 0
FORMAT: Step-by-step solution with verification
CONSTRAINTS: Algebra II level, explain factoring method, <250 tokens
```

**Optimized AI Response (Token Count: 235):**
```
Let's solve 2x² - 8x + 6 = 0 step by step!

ANALYSIS: We need to find x values that make this equation true.

STEP 1: Factor out common factor
2x² - 8x + 6 = 0
2(x² - 4x + 3) = 0

STEP 2: Factor the quadratic
x² - 4x + 3 = (x - 3)(x - 1)
So: 2(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0

STEP 3: Solve using zero product property
x - 3 = 0  →  x = 3
x - 1 = 0  →  x = 1

VERIFICATION: 
x = 3: 2(9) - 8(3) + 6 = 18 - 24 + 6 = 0 ✓
x = 1: 2(1) - 8(1) + 6 = 2 - 8 + 6 = 0 ✓

PRACTICE: Try 3x² - 12x + 9 = 0

```

**Optimized AI Response (Token Count: 242):**
```
PHOTOSYNTHESIS EXPLAINED:

DEFINITION: The process plants use to make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

COOKING ANALOGY: Think of leaves as solar-powered kitchens! Plants take three ingredients (sunlight energy, water from roots, CO₂ from air) and "cook" them together to make sugar (their food) plus oxygen (our air!).

WHY IT MATTERS: Without photosynthesis, we'd have no oxygen to breathe and no food to eat - it's the foundation of all life on Earth!

CONNECTION: This process is the opposite of cellular respiration (how we use oxygen and sugar for energy).

DID YOU KNOW? One large tree produces enough oxygen for two people for an entire day!

COMPREHENSION CHECK: What do you think would happen to a plant if you put it in a dark closet for a week? Why?
