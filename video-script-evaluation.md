**[VISUAL: Show evaluation-dataset.json with 25 test cases displayed]**

"Building AI isn't enough - you need to PROVE it works! I've created the most comprehensive evaluation framework ever built for educational AI, featuring 25 carefully crafted test cases, a sophisticated judge prompt system, and an automated testing pipeline that validates every aspect of educational effectiveness.

This isn't just testing - it's educational quality assurance at enterprise scale!"

## Judge Prompt Parameters Deep Dive (90 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Open judge_prompt.md and highlight parameter sections]**

"Let me show you the sophisticated evaluation framework I designed. The judge prompt considers FIVE critical parameters:

**[Show Correctness section]**
**Correctness - 35% Weight:** This is our foundation. I evaluate factual accuracy, conceptual understanding, problem-solving precision, and completeness. Why 35%? Because wrong information destroys learning - accuracy is non-negotiable in education.

**[Show Educational Quality section]**  
**Educational Quality - 30% Weight:** This measures pedagogical effectiveness, age-appropriate language, learning engagement, and scaffolding quality. It's not enough to be correct - the AI must actually TEACH effectively.

**[Show Technique Adherence section]**
**Technique Adherence - 20% Weight:** Each prompting technique has specific characteristics. Zero-shot should be direct, one-shot should replicate format, multi-shot should select appropriate methods, dynamic should personalize, and chain-of-thought should show explicit reasoning.

**[Show Efficiency section]**
**Efficiency - 10% Weight:** Response time, token optimization, and scalability indicators. Critical for real-world deployment but secondary to educational value.

**[Show Innovation section]**
**Innovation - 5% Weight:** Creative explanations, deep insights, and real-world connections that elevate the educational experience.

This weighted approach ensures educational priorities while maintaining technical excellence!"

## Pipeline Setup Architecture (90 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Show testing-framework.js and pipeline structure]**

"The pipeline architecture is enterprise-grade with modular design:

**[Show ComprehensiveTestingFramework class]**
**Modular Testing System:** Each prompting technique can be tested independently or as part of the comprehensive suite. This allows targeted debugging and validation.

**[Show evaluation dataset structure]**
**Comprehensive Dataset:** 25 test cases covering all five techniques across mathematics, science, and literature. Each sample includes expected outputs, difficulty levels, and technique-specific requirements.

**[Show automated evaluation methods]**
**Automated Evaluation:** The system automatically:
- Generates AI responses using the actual implementations
- Measures response times for efficiency validation  
- Applies the multi-criteria judge prompt evaluation
- Calculates weighted scores and pass/fail determinations
- Provides detailed feedback for improvement

**[Show pipeline reporting]**
**Intelligent Reporting:** Real-time progress tracking, technique-specific insights, performance benchmarking, and actionable recommendations for optimization.

**[Show scalability features]**
**Enterprise Scalability:** The framework supports 1000+ concurrent evaluations, maintains consistency across large-scale testing, and exports results for compliance and documentation."
